      <p style="background-color: white">Absoluter Rubin is about rubbish. These ‘works’ are found things which would be described as rubbish. I haven’t put much time into them and there was no cost in making them and absolutely anyone could do it. So in order to make these works ‘make sense’ to a viewer who would disregard it at first glance I will have to pose the following questions which relates to the art of ‘rubbish’. </p>
      <p >The scary question of what art actually is. If you are to call these works art you simply cannot help to think about that dreaded question especially to a viewer who is not familiar with the readymade. I’d like to think of these works as sitting on the edge of art. It is hard to answer the question of what art actually is and these works are a partial answer. They answer the question by combining the elements of art into a strong connection to reality.
      Reality in order to talk about reality one must venture through philosophical thoughts of phenomenology and the philosophys relation to art.</p>
      <p>Bits of canvas, the placement of the surfaces reminiscent to an ongoing history of abstract painting and collage. This particular work has come from a history of personal exploration of painting. Figurative drawing from life- drawing from the mind- --- ABSTRACTION-. Does ‘reality’ lose its meaning if you think about it too much?

      <p>The viewer is important to the art. </p>

      <p>Is the readymade happened and done?</p>
